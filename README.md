# Extension which simply collect of invoices

That extension connects to the website and download the new invoices.
In that version, the "save as" popup appears and the user can choose the destination folder. Next version could skip that to improve automation.
When clicking it goes to the website, reconnect if needed and download the new invoices.  
If something is not working as expected the tab will stay open (to enter creds, ask for double authentication, etc.)
otherwise, it will be closed.

## Try development version

- [Download last release](https://github.com/remmel/findinvoice-chrome-extension/releases)
